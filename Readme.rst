Installing/Updating packaged app
================================

The goal is to run ``bash.sh`` and have the app installed on current
running B2G instance.

Currently it is in a proof of concept state (unproven).

Usage
#####

1. run B2G

2. host the directory (python servepackage.py)

3. run test.sh

   It is creating the package.zip, and runs test.py
